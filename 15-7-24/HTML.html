    <p>HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and web applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.<br>

        Hyper Text: HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.<br>
        
        Markup language: A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.<br>
        
        Web Page: A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A web page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.<br>
        <!DOCTYPE>: It defines the document type or it instruct the browser about the version of HTML.

        html :This tag informs the browser that it is an HTML document. Text between html tag describes the web document. It is a container for all other elements of HTML except DOCTYPE<br>

        head: It should be the first element inside the element, which contains the metadata(information about the document). It must be closed before the body tag opens.<br>

        title: As its name suggested, it is used to add title of that HTML page which appears at the top of the browser window. It must be placed inside the head tag and should close immediately<br>
